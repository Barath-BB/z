# Diabetes Detection Streamlit App

A simple Streamlit app for diabetes detection using machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project provides a **diabetes detection app** built using **Streamlit** for the user interface and a **machine learning model** to predict whether a person has diabetes or not. The model is trained on a dataset and can predict the outcome based on the input features provided by the user.

## Features

- User-friendly interface using **Streamlit**.
- Real-time predictions based on user input.
- Uses a **machine learning model** for diabetes detection.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps to Run the App

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Barath-BB/diabetes-detection-streamlit.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd diabetes-detection-streamlit
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    This will start a local server and open the app in your default web browser.

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can input the following features (example features from the dataset):

- Age
- BMI
- Blood Pressure
- Glucose levels
- Insulin levels
- Skin Thickness

Click **Submit** to get the prediction whether you have diabetes or not.
